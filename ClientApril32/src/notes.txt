If repeating chunks is not set to true, every player update needs to jump to the
next nearest timecode that is in a chunk. It will have to iterate through all
chunks every time when it receieves a player update. If the new time is already
in a chunk, good. If it isn't, iterate through all chunks until it finds a start
time that is greater than the new time. Jump to this chunk and seek the player.

currently, jump to chunk does not actually cause the player to seek. 

The only way of navigating the timeline is through the inputs. Selecting an input should always jump to the beginning of its chunk.
